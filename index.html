      <h2>A Little bit about myself</h2>
      <h3>Passionate Learner</h3>
      <p>I'm always looking for new skills to learn. Whether its soft skills like time management, or practical skills such as learning a new coding language,
      I am always looking for ways to expand my skillset so that I can both pick up new skills that may be useful to me in the future.</p>

      <h3>Active Community Member</h3>
      <p>When I first moved to Canada in 2017, I made a promise to myself that I would try my best to get involved with the new community that I will be living in.
      Now, 3 years after the move, I believe that I have accomplished my goal through joining extra-curricular acacdmic activities and volunteering.</p>

      <h3>Tech Enthusiast</h3>
      <p>From 5G Technology to the latest computer hardware components, I am fascinated by the advancements constantly being made within the tech industry. I believe that, by keeping up with the latest technology,
      not only will I gain knowledge of upcoming advancements, I will also know what technologies are soon to be avaliable so that I may see how my workflow can be optimized with the newest technologies.</p>

        <h3>Automation Stream Representitave - B.Tech Association</h3>
          <p>During my first year at MacMaster University, I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to represent my stream of study with the role of Automation Stream Representitave.
            The main purpose of this role is to represent my stream of study at open-house events and voice the opinions of my fellow colleagues.
            To do this, I attend bi-weekly meetings where new event ideas are brought up with other stream representitaves.</p>
