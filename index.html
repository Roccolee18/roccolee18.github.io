      <p>I'm always looking for new skills to learn. Whether its soft skills like time management, or practical skills such as learning a new coding language,
      I am always looking for ways to expand my skillset so that I can both pick up new skills that may be useful to me in the future, but to also practice initiative and
      figure out how I can solve a problem on my own.</p>
