      <h2>A Little bit about myself</h2>
      <h3>Passionate Learner</h3>
      <p>Whether its soft skills like time management, or practical skills such as learning a new coding language,
      I am always looking for ways to expand my skillset so that I can both pick up new skills that may be useful to me in the future.</p>

      <h3>Active Community Member</h3>
      <p>When I first moved to Canada in 2017, I made a promise to myself that I would try my best to get involved with the new community that I will be living in.
      Now, 3 years after the move, I believe that I have accomplished my goal through joining extra-curricular acacdmic activities and volunteering.</p>

      <h3>Tech Enthusiast</h3>
      <p>I am fascinated by the advancements constantly being made within the tech industry! I believe that, by keeping up with the latest technology,
      not only will I gain knowledge of upcoming advancements, I will also know what technologies are soon to be avaliable so that I may see how my workflow can be optimized with the newest technologies.</p>
